All notable changes to the SkillTotal engine. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com); the project uses
[SemVer](https://semver.org). See `RULES_CHANGELOG.md` for detection-rule changes.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **npm / PyPI package collection** (`collector.py`): `collect()` now resolves `npm:<name>`
  and `pypi:<name>` specs (and `npmjs.com` / `pypi.org` URLs) by downloading the latest
  published release from the registry and extracting it safely (path-traversal and
  decompression-bomb guards; links skipped). New helpers `classify_source`,
  `npm_package_name`, `pypi_package_name`.
- Versioned engine contract: `ENGINE_VERSION`, `REPORT_SCHEMA_VERSION`, `RULESET_VERSION`
  (`skilltotal/__init__.py`); `schema_version` and `ruleset_version` in report `metadata`.
- Formal report contract `docs/report.schema.json` (schema version 1.0) and a contract-guard
  test (`tests/test_report_schema.py`) that validates every fixture report against it.
- Process docs: `docs/contributing-rules.md`, `docs/releasing.md`.

## [0.1.0]

### Added
- Initial CLI engine: collector, file index/evidence engine, 11 scanners, capability
  extraction, scoring (filesystem+network combo critical), text/JSON/SARIF reports, baseline
  suppression, AST-based Python analysis, hidden-Unicode detection, MCP tool classification
  (JSON + code). Zero runtime dependencies.
